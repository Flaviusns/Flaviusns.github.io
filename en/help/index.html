    </p>
    <h3>Bad format file</h3>
    <p>Be sure the compress file is using a valid compression format and includes the correct extension. The only valid
        extension are<br><br>
        .cbz files, cbr files and cb7 files. Also be sure the decompress folder follow the next structure:<br><br>
        The root folder contains the name of the comic and inside this root folder you have directly the pages of the
        comic.<br><br>
        To check this, you can decompress your cbz,cbr or cb7 file using <a href="https://www.keka.io/">Keka</a><br><br>
        Here's an image with a correct structure:<br><br>
        <img src="../../common/GoodStructure.png" alt="Image with the correct structure of a comic"> <br><br>
        And here's one with a bad structure:<br><br>
        <img src="../../common/BadStructure.png" alt="Image with a bad structure of a comic">
        <br><br>
        Be sure that the name of the comic is the same as the root folder.<br><br>
        Once you have a comic with the correct structure, you can compress the comic using a diferent format, the best
        format for our app is<br>
        the cbz file.<br><br> To compress a comic with cbz format, select the root folder of your comic and compress it them
        to zip format. Then change the file extension
        from zip to cbz and then send it to your device.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Bad name</h3>
    <p>Once common issue is to have a comic name with a different name than the original one.<br>
    Decompress your commic using <a href="https://www.keka.io/">Keka</a> and be sure that the name of the comic is the same as the root folder.<br><br>
    For example, if the name of the comic is MySuperComic.cbz. When you decompress the file, the root folder should be MySuperComic.<br><br>
    If the root folder has another name, please change it and compress again the folder to zip, and then change the file extension to cbz.<br><br>
    Example: MySuperComicRenamed.zip -> MySuperComicRenamed.cbz
    </p>
    <h2>Why the cover is not the first page?</h2>
    <p>If you have a comic and the cover is not the image that you see in the collection view, please follow the next steps:<br><br>
        Decompress the file<br><br>
        Open the root folder and check if the cover is the first image if you order the content by name<br><br>
        If not, change the name of the cover to be the first in the folder<br><br>
        Compress again the folder to zip, and then change the file extension to cbz.
